		<p class="story-ingress"><strong>Jackie Auriemma</strong> was frustrated. Over and over she heard the same story from her friends: <br>they had to throw away their kids' old toys & clothes that were in perfectly good condition, <br>because it was too difficult to find anyone who would want them.</p>

			<div class="story-content">
			
				<p>"They said that Craigslist was too scary. Then there were the parent groups in Facebook, but they didn't feel convenient enough."</p>
			
				<p>As a parent herself, Jackie knew the issue all too well. She decided to do something about it. Her concept was simple: a trusted marketplace where parents could easily buy pre-owned toys, clothes and accessories from each other. "Simply browse them from your couch, order them through the site, from people you can really trust, and get them shipped to your door. No hassle."</p>

				<p>First Jackie looked into getting her site custom-built. However, she soon realized that it would be really expensive. "It would have taken me ages to save up that kind of money".</p>

				<p>Then a friend mentioned Sharetribe. Jackie checked it out and was thrilled. "You get a site that looks really good and works well without having to spend lots of money."</p>

				<p>Jackie had no previous experience in setting up websites. With Sharetribe, that wasn't a problem. "The Sharetribe team was really helpful. I bombarded them with lots of questions regarding my concept and they were always there for me."</p>

				<p>Jackie is still testing out different business models for her site. "Right now I'm taking a small cut from each payment. However, in the future I might try ads, or enabling people to get their listing featured to the top of the site by paying."</p>
