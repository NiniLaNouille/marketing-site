    <p class="story-ingress">Like many great marketplace concepts, Casa Guau was born out of a <br class="responsive-br">personal need. <strong>Mario Hego</strong> needed to find a sitter for his dog, <br class="responsive-br">but it proved difficult. He didn't want to resort to a pet hotel.</p>

      <div class="story-content">

        <p>"I lived in New York for a while, and my girlfriend there had a cat and a dog. There were many sites where you could find people next door to take care of your pets. In Mexico we don't really have that. So I thought I'd do something about it."</p>

        <p>Mario discovered some Mexican sites that offered similar services, but found them really old-fashioned. "I wanted to create a modern marketplace, with good support for geolocation, filtering, etc."</p>

        <p>He started learning programming to build his own site, but soon discovered that it would take him a lot of time to master the level needed to build a professional site. So he began to look for platforms that would do it for him.</p>

        <p>"I checked some other providers, but they were 4-5 times more expensive than Sharetribe. With Sharetribe, I was able to quickly create a modern marketplace that really stands out from the competition."</p>

        <p>Currently Mario is building the initial inventory for his marketplace. He has multiple ideas for monetization. "I might partner with a dog food provider and display their promotions on the site. I'll also probably test a subscription model. Yellow pages is super expensive but people still pay to get featured there. I can offer the service providers a much cheaper alternative to get visibility."</p>
