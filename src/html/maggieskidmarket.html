    <p class="story-ingress">Over and over <strong>Jaclyn Kelly</strong> heard the same story from her friends: they had to <br class="responsive-br">throw away their kids' old toys and clothes that were in perfectly good condition, <br class="responsive-br">because it was too difficult to find anyone who would want them.</p>

      <div class="story-content">

        <p>"They said that Craigslist was too scary. Then there were the parent groups on Facebook, but they didn't feel convenient enough."</p>

        <p>As a parent herself, Jaclyn knew the issue all too well. She decided to do something about it. Her concept was simple: a trusted place online where parents could connect and buy pre-owned toys, clothes and accessories from each other. "Simply browse them from your couch and order them through the site, from people you can really trust. You can either meet the seller in person or order the items to be shipped to your door."</p>

        <p>First Jaclyn looked into getting her site custom-built. However, she soon realized that it would be really expensive. "It would have taken me ages to save up that kind of money".</p>

        <p>Then a friend mentioned Sharetribe. Jaclyn checked it out and was thrilled. "You get a site that looks really good and works well without having to spend lots of money."</p>

        <p>Jaclyn didn't have too much previous experience in setting up websites. With Sharetribe, that wasn't a problem. "The Sharetribe team was really helpful. I bombarded them with lots of questions regarding my concept and they were always there for me."</p>

        <p>Jaclyn is still testing out different business models for her site. "Right now I'm taking a small cut from each payment. However, in the future I might try ads or some other revenue sources. I don't want to push the cost to our members. I want to allow them to keep their money and find other ways to fund the site."</p>
